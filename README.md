# Manifest

This repository documents the Manifest project using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

## Building the book

1. Install mdBook (for example with `cargo install mdbook`).
2. Build the documentation:

```bash
mdbook build
```

The generated HTML will be available in the `book/` directory. Use `mdbook serve` for a live preview during writing.
